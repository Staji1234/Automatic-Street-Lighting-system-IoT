# Automatic-Street-Lighting-system-IoT
The system is mainly used for smart and adaptive lighting in street lights. The project is implemented with smart embedded system that controls the street light based on detection of sunlight. During the night time the street light gets automatically ON and during the day time it gets automatically OFF. The ON/OFF can be accessed anywhere anytime through internet. The manual operation using GSM technology is completely eliminated. Thus the system is mainly designed to ensure safety and to prevent energy wastage. Here we are also using WiFi to manually control it just as an alternative using an app. The data will be sent to the cloud for storage and analysis where reports can be generated to show the duration when lights are ON, the amount of power consumed and saved.
